!  Initially,  the truck  is parked in  neutral, engine stopped,  park brake
!  set.  Start  the engine by holding the throttle trigger  for two seconds. 
!  Case-insensitive  but, by convention, 'T'  for hold and 't'  for release. 
!  Similarly, 'G' for upshift and 'g' for downshift.  'A' and 'B' for couple
!  and 'a' and 'b' for decouple.

!  We  could shut the engine  down again, with  the gear in neutral  and the
!  park  brake set, by holding T  again for two seconds;  but instead, we'll
!  pulse  T to release the  Park brakes, (while meanwhile  applying the foot
!  brake).

!  Now engage first  gear by holding T and clicking the  Gear selector to go
!  up one gear into first.  With the throttle held, we should now accelerate

!  We can use  L, R and C to turn the  steering wheels progressively Left or
!  Right or Center them, respectively.  Then are ten degrees of Left and ten
!  of  Right.  It  takes time  to turn  the wheel.   (We could  use L  as an
!  increment  and Ln  as a goto  degree n.  Then  we could  use l0 or  r0 to
!  center the wheels.

!  this delay is to allow the truck to accelerate to an appreciable speed.

!   Turn the  front wheels  Left or  Right  up to  45 degrees,  in 5  degree
!  increments, using L1..L9 and R1..R9.  Use  L0 or R0 to center the wheels. 
!  It takes 1 second for the wheels to swivel 45 degrees.

!  NB: holding T in a Gear,  maintains the target speed at a "nice" RPM.  To
!  accelerate, you select a higher  gear, but the RPM increases to the shift
!  point, then the gear shifts up  and the RPM falls once more to the "nice"
!  RPM.
