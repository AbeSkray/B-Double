This is a quick guide for setting up the javahidapi library. Some steps may
be left out.

**Get the B-Double hidapi branch**
  git fetch
  git checkout hidapi

**Get B-Double set up in Eclipse**
  Add Java Project to your workspace
  Uncheck 'Use default location'
  Use B-Double/java/src
  Name it 'B-Double'

**Get javahidapi**
  The project is hosted on Google Code.
  hg clone https://code.google.com/p/javahidapi/
  Take a look at javahidapi/linux/README.txt
    You can choose between Libusb or Hidraw. I got Libusb to work:
      sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev
  Next, look at javahidapi/README.txt; those instructions are useful:
    1. make -C linux
    2. ant
  Next:
    3. Confirm javahidapi/bin/hidapi.jar
    4. Edit javahidapi/build.xml
       In the 'run' target, change the java.library.path to
       ${basedir}/linux
       (instead of ${basedir}/mac)
    5. ant jar (this creates javahidapi/bin/hidapi.jar)
    6. (Optional) try: ant run
       If you get permissions errors, try: sudo chmod 666 /dev/bus/usb/005/*

**Set up build path in Eclipse**
  1. Right-click B-Double project
  2. Build Path -> Configure Build Path
  3. Libraries Tab
  4. Add Variable...
     Add a JAVAHIDAPI_HOME variable
     This should be the base directory for the hidapi project
     ex.: '/home/aknowles/projects/javahidapi'
     JAVAHIDAPI_HOME/bin/hidapi.jar should already be in the project classpath
  5. Expand the classpath entry
     Edit the 'Native library location' to the correct absolute path
     For some reason JAVAHIDAPI_HOME/linux doesn't work here :-/

**Run Test Main from Eclipse**
  1. Right-click on HidControl.java
  2. Run as Java Application
  3. If you get write permissions error(s) try something like:
     sudo chmod 666 /dev/usb/bus/005/*
  4. You should get a list of all USB HID devices connected to the machine
     (make sure to connect some!)
