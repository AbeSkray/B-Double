Consider trying VisualSwing4Eclipse plugin (GUI designer)
Or Window Builder? - had trouble installing... 

How do I exclude files/directories from 'git status'?
.gitignore file -- just like .cvsignore

Abstractly, what are the user control inputs to the sim?
 o Throttle 
   - either on or off
   - completely binary
   - button down, button up
 o Steering
   - a one-dimensional value between -1.0 and 1.0?
 o Transmission
   - a one-off instantaneous event
   - context in terms of throttle determines action
TestControlPanel
 o Throttle could be a checkbox
 o Steering could be a slider
 o Transmission could be a button
